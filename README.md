# Future Simulations of Sugarcane Yield and Sucrose

- Evaluate what is the best option methodolgy to predict final yield and sucrose for the current season;
- First version using only DSSAT/CANEGRO
- Evaluate for 30 years data

- Four methods: 
m1 = Median of past years
m2 = Use of the wth with best match between monthly rainfall and normal rainfall
m3 = Use of the output with best match with current simulated data up to "today"
m4 = Use of the average outputs with best match with current simulated data up to "today" (2 years BIAS >0 and BIAS <0)
